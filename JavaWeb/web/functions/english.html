                OK, Gentlemen. Since all of you are choosing watches for your employees. Why not give a thought to our
                New generation of watches--The MI band? I think our brand can satisfy all of your demands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Especially for the general clerks, I think the MI band is the best choose.Because its outlook is attractive and
                meanwhile the price is reasonable.Comparing to the traditional mechanical watch, the MI band have the incomparable
                price, precision and functional advantage.
            </p>
                And for enterprise senior managers, if the price is reasonable, we could provide customized services and 
                you know my taste can be rivalled with Steve Jobs.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Oh, Sir. You must be the trendsetter in the tech world. Through our algorithm engineers' efforts, the new generation of
                MI band is equipped with the function of the measurement to heart-rate, blood oxygen , concentration and so on. And The chip
                on the MI band also could take advantage of these data collected by sensors to do some analysis and calculations.That
                means, the band could measure the mental status whose owner is wearing it.With these "Black Technology",I think you
                could know the employee is loaf on the job or not easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of its GPS chip and locate algorithm, the function of locate has quite mature for our MI band. I
                think as long as your demands are legitimate, you will be satisfied with our product.
            </p>
            <p class="question">Does it have a long battery life? How long should I charge it?</p>
            <p>
                For the several previous products` increasingly poor problem of endurance , our engineers pay much attention to the
                power consumption and charge method. In this latest version, we provided multi-ways to charge,such as: wireless, solar
                and traditional ways. That means, if you want, the charging progress is absolutely occurs in the background. These ways
                of charging ensured that you can charge in the way as convenient as possible,and the MI band also has a low power
                consumption. So, I think this watch could charge once over half a year.
            </p>

            <p class="question">Can we design a matching software for our company to manage our employee by the band?
                Can you provide customized solutions and software package to meet the needs of our company?</p>
            <p>
                Emmm, I think that`s absolutely ok! Our MI band reserved some interfaces for supporting upper computer.
                You can discuss this demand with our Product Manager about more technical detail.
            </p>
            <p class="question">Does this watch distinguish lies and truth?</p>
            <p>
                Are you OK? I think you must be joking! Though I should see you as Jehovah, I think What you expect from
                your employees is simply unreasonable. I think my MI band could not be your tools to pry into other
                people`s privacy although these people are your employee.
